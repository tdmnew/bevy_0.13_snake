# bevy_0.13_snake

A simple snake game made with Bevy 0.13, adapted from [marcusbuffett's bevy_snake](https://github.com/marcusbuffett/bevy_snake) to work in v0.13.

The original tutorial from [mbuffett.com](https://mbuffett.com/posts/bevy-snake-tutorial/) seems to be held in pretty high regard in terms of what to do once you've finished the [bevy quick start](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction/). However, there's been a number of changes to Bevy since then, meaning sections of the tutorial are no longer applicable to later versions. I don't know how helpful this will be to those that are just starting out as well (considering this was created while learning bevy + rust in tandem), but hopefully it might just help somebody else out that was confused by the changes between these versions. Some slight tweaks have been made here and there.

The 'homework' exercises that were in the original tutorial haven't been implemented. They're good exercises somebody would probably want to tackle on their own. Also, I've made this with Bevy v0.13 (rather than v0.14) as I'm using an M1 Macbook Air with Ashai Linux, and v0.14 doesn't seem to work at the moment ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
